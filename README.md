# BattleBot_picow_xbox
The goal of this repository is to create a bottle bot chassis of 2 drive motors set in tank drive and a weapon motor. The PWM signals will be direct forward only controls for the drivetrain (transistors instead of motor controllers for the price factor) and uni-directional based upon for the blade.
